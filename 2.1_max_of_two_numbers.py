# Solution
print("Enter a number: ")
number1 = int(input())
print("Enter another number: ")
number2 = int(input())
if number1 > number2:

    print(number1, "is larger than", number2)
else:
    print(number2, "is larger than", number1)

# Alternate Solution
print("Enter a number: ")
number1 = int(input())
print("Enter another number: ")
number2 = int(input())
# max function is used to find the max number of two numbers
print(max(number1, number2))
